**Scratch** is an open source OS build from the ground up in Assembly. For the time being, it is meant as a resource to others aspiring to delve into the scary depths of Assembly-based OS development.

Building
--------
To build, just run `./build.sh`. Currently, this only works in Mac OS X, but the end goal is to have build scripts for Windows and Linux as well.

Running
-------
This code was designed to run in virtual machines as well as on actual hardware. It has been tested to boot in [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org) and on an actual (old) laptop.

Special Thanks
--------------
Special thanks to the fine community at [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com). Without their expert advice, I'd probably [still be stuck with some cryptic boot error](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10006624).

Another special thanks to [BrokenThorn Entertainment](http://brokenthorn.com), which provides [an (in)famous OS development tutorial](http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html), which this code is significantly based on.
